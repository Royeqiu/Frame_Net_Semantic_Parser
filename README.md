# Frame_Net_Semantic_Parser

This semantic parser is based on structure defined in the semantic corpous collected by Berkeley research group: https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/

The architecture is different from SEMAFOR 2.1:http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/SEMAFOR/ that is based on probability mechanism. The semantic role model is based on Bi-directional LSTM to improve overall performance. We can also add new semantic frame and add more semantic role by ourselves.

Thank you for both reference(FrameNet„ÄÅSEMAFOR).
